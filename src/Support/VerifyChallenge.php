/**
 * The proof this shop returns to show it controls its own hostname.
 *
 * NitroSearch issues a random nonce and fetches this module's public verify
 * controller over a server-to-server request. We answer with an HMAC over the
 * sync secret. A caller that does not hold that secret cannot produce the proof,
 * so a site that merely REFLECTS the nonce never passes — which is the whole
 * point, and the reason the endpoint can safely be public.
 *
 *   proof = hex(hmac_sha256(sync_secret, "nitrosearch-verify-v1\n" + nonce))
 *
 * THE PREFIX IS DOMAIN SEPARATION, NOT DECORATION. The ingest canonical string
 * starts with "v1\n"; this one starts with "nitrosearch-verify-v1\n". Because the
 * two input spaces cannot collide, the public verify endpoint can never be used
 * as a signing oracle to forge an ingest request — someone who can ask us to sign
 * arbitrary nonces still cannot obtain a signature over an ingest canonical.
 * Removing or shortening the prefix would quietly turn a public endpoint into a
 * way to sign anything.

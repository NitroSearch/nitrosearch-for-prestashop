# Guard the storefront widget's label catalogues.
#
# The search panel a shopper reads is drawn by a shared bundle that carries no
# locales: it renders English unless this module sends `cfg.labels`. Nothing
# fails when a label is missing — the bundle falls back to its own English, per
# key, and the panel looks completely correct to anyone who reads English. The
# only symptom is a shopper in Bucharest reading a word nobody chose for them.
# There is no crash to catch here, so the catalogues have to be checked directly.
#
#   bin/check-widget-labels.sh              # check the working tree
#   bin/check-widget-labels.sh --self-test  # prove the checks still bite
#
# ⚠ TWO MODES, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. The strongest
# check — do the committed catalogues still match the reviewed gettext sources
# they were derived from — needs the sibling checkouts, which exist on a
# developer's machine and not in CI. A guard that quietly downgrades to nothing
# when its input is missing is the failure this project keeps finding, so the
# checks that DO work standalone always run, the run says which mode it was in,
# and an empty catalogue set is an error rather than a green zero.

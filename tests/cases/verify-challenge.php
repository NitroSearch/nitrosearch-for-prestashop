/**
 * PROOF OF CONTROL — the hash that says "this shop is really at that address".
 *
 * The service sends a nonce to the module's public verify route and expects a
 * hash only a holder of this shop's sync secret could produce. Getting it wrong
 * means a shop can connect but never verify, which is a dead install that looks
 * healthy: the catalogue syncs and the storefront never gets a search key.
 *
 * Pinned as literals for the same reason as the HMAC vector — recording this
 * module's own output as the expectation would prove only self-consistency, and
 * both sides drifting together is the failure worth catching.
